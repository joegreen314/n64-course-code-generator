Might be really hard to do the likelihoods
Maybe go through race by race, and calculate the odds of total weights for that round
Could eliminate really unlikely ones, which should limit the groupings to ~10
Just do approximation.  Lower the total count by the average.  Only need to do it by tier
Calculate 2 or 3 times?
